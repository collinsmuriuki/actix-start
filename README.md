> Just me trying out actix web. Initially felt like a bloated mess, but further exploration of features such as the ServiceFactory
> and web scope add some level of modularity I like. Logging implementation is also pretty neat.
> 
> Will continue to further explore axtix and attempt to use microservices like Redis with it and see how it holds up before I give Rocket a trial
